<h3>Disability specific examples</h3>
* Apply for a blue badge parking permit?<br>
* Apply for Personal Independence Payments?<br>
* Apply for a disabled person's bus pass?
 
<h3>Broader examples</h3>
* Apply for a passport?<br>
* Buy a house?<br>
* Travel abroad during Covid?<br><br>
 
Accessio finds relevant websites, reads, compares and summarises them, to create a step-by-step visual user journey map that guides you on what needs to be done, and when.
 
<h2>Technology</h2>
 
Using Artificial Intelligence, Accessio summarises text from numerous sources such as government documents, advice websites and online forums. 
 
Accessio uses Natural Language Processing algorithms, in a range of supervised and unsupervised models to break down text into instructions, and then maps these into a user journey map.
 
All of Accessio’s user journey maps use templates that are compatible with the latest accessibility technology - such as translation tools, screen readers and personalised display preferences - to support users with a range of accessibility needs.

To be built using Python, or Azure Machine Learning

<h2>Summary</h2>
 
When starting a new process it can be difficult to understand the steps that need to be followed. In an ever changing world, when we want to do something it’s not always clear what the latest procedure is. To overcome an information overload, Machine Learning helps us handle a growing deluge of documents, websites and forums.
 
There is an increasing number of data scientists using Natural Language Processing to advance tech’s ability to summarise text. Accessio is different because it focuses primarily on **procedural text**, and processing this into a user friendly, accessible **visual output**.
