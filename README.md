<h2 align="center">Training Natural Language Processing Artificial Intelligence (NLP) to support people with additional needs into education and/or into the workforce, no matter their spoken language or dialect.<br>
<br></h2>

<h3>Problem</h3>
In Jamaica, only 15% of the population living with disabilities are registered to receive their eligible benefits & support. Thousands of people, like my Aunt Angela, go unsupported. People face technical difficulties in the registration process. Speech recognition technology can help. However, current technology doesn’t understand Jamaican Patois because AI algorithms are not trained with relevant Jamaican Patois and disability-specific datasets.
 
<h3>Solution</h3>

Accessio will develop NLP datasets for Jamaican Patois. For the first time, people with disabilities, who speak Jamaican Patois will also be able to access assistive technologies using their native language.

Accessio is an open-source web app that can be used on smartphones or web browsers.
 
<h3>Landscape</h3>

In 2022, AI’s biggest names (DeepMind, open-ai, Hugging Face) will further improve the use and development of NLP technology.

However, current algorithms are trained on traditional written sources such as newspapers, books, and articles which use standard, formal structures of language. A language is rarely spoken in exactly the same way by everyone, and in reality people have their own accents, dialects, and slang, etc.

NLP is yet to be developed for Jamaican Patois and other Caribbean languages and dialects. Their is a growing community of developers working on development of NLP models for African languages, Chinese and Korean languages are also major steps forward.

There are currently 3 major Caribbean languages which have no existing NLP datasets. These are:
<ul>Haitian Creole (9.6 million speakers)</ul>
<ul>Jamaican Patois (3.2 million speakers)</ul>
<ul>Trinidadian Creole (1 million speakers)</ul>

NLP, AI and future technologies to come, should be accessible to everyone, no matter a person's language. Accessio aims to include a large number of people who are currently on the edge of this technology, unable to access all of the benefits and oppurutnities that exist.

<h2>The Tech</h2>

<h3>Input</h3>
<ul>Accessio listens to the user.</ul>

<h3>Process</h3>
<ul>User's speech is converted to text.</ul>
<ul>Text is converted to NLP tokens and processed through transformers specifically trained with understanding Jamaican Patois.</ul>

<h3>Output</h3>
<ul>Accessio provides an appropriate response.</ul>
